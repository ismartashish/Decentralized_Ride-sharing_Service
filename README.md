# Decentralized Ride-sharing Service

## Project Description
Decentralized Ride-sharing Service is a peer-to-peer platform that connects drivers and riders directly, eliminating intermediaries. Payments and ride agreements are managed transparently using smart contracts on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to create a fair, efficient, and trustless ride-sharing ecosystem where drivers receive full earnings and riders pay lower fares. By leveraging blockchain, the platform ensures secure, tamper-proof, and automated transactions.

## Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized identity verification for driver and rider safety.
- Real-time ride tracking using blockchain-based GPS services.
- Implementation of a rating and reputation system for users.
- Multi-token support for payments, including stablecoins.

## Key Features
- Riders can request rides and drivers can accept them via smart contracts.
- Payments are securely processed on the blockchain without intermediaries.
- Transparent rating and feedback system to ensure trust.
- Automated escrow-based payment release upon ride completion.
